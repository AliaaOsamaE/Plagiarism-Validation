#Plagiarism Validation Tool
This project is a plagiarism validation tool developed in C#, designed to analyze document similarities using graph algorithms.

##Features
✅ Graph-based analysis

Utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Kruskal's algorithm for efficient graph construction and minimum spanning tree (MST) generation.

Identifies clusters of similar documents and key connections.

✅ Data handling

Reads document pairs, similarity percentages, and line match information from Excel files.

Processes data to build a graph representing document relationships.

✅ Output generation

Produces an MST file representing the minimum spanning connections between documents.

Generates a statistics file summarizing document components and similarity metrics.
